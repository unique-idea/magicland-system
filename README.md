A final capstone project 
Magic Land is a B2C project that we implement together with Tâm Huyết Việt Joint Stock Company. The basic idea of the project is to build a system serving a children's training center from 4 to 10 years old, focusing on developing STEM skills.

The current solution and orientation of the system: 
* The system supports managing the registration process.
* The system will help parents track their children's learning process, including study time, *progress, and learning results.
The system suggests suitable courses for parents to register their children.
Providing utilities to facilitate the learning process.
